# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Git Ignore for calu infra repository
# This file ensures only specific subfolders of Code-Base are tracked,
# while other core infrastructure components are fully included.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Code-Base specific rules ---
# By default, ignore the entire 'Code-Base' directory and all its contents recursively.
# This prevents unintended tracking of other service repositories.
Code-Base/

# EXCEPTION: Explicitly unignore the specific subdirectories from Code-Base that need to be tracked.
# These rules override the broader 'Code-Base/' ignore rule above.
!Code-Base/GENERAL-SERVICES/
!Code-Base/SYSTEM-SCRIPTS/

# --- Other top-level items ---
# The following top-level directories and files are implicitly tracked by Git
# (because they are not ignored by any rules above). You do NOT need to add
# explicit !rules for them unless you had a very broad ignore (like /*) initially.
#
# - Database/
# - Docker-Environment-Orchestration/
# - Monitoring/
# - README.md
# - bootstrap-services.sh
# - clone-services.sh
# - run-me-before-running-docker.sh
#
# No specific .gitignore rules needed for these as they are not affected
# by the 'Code-Base/' ignore rule.
